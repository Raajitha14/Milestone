      <h2>Gateway of India</h2>
      <p>Standing an impressive 85 feet tall and located on the waterfront at Mumbai Harbour on the tip of Apollo Bunder, overlooking the Arabian Sea, the iconic Gateway of India is a bold yellow basalt arch of colonial triumph and a must-see when in Mumbai. Incorporating Islamic styles of 16th-century Gujarat, it was built to commemorate the arrival of King George V and his wife 
        Queen Mary in 1911 and was opened with much pomp and ceremony in 1924. It was, for a while, the tallest structure in the city.</p>
